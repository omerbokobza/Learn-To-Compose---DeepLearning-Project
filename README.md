# Learn To Compose, DeepLearning Project
GAN model for generate a new classical piece based on dataset of classical pieces
The project was built in a unique way based on the concept of the **generational GAN model**.

All the steps, including the code are in the PDF file named "FinalProject".

**The project was done as part of the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course taught by Dr. Nir Schlesinger at Ben Gurion University (Be'er Sheva, Israel)**
